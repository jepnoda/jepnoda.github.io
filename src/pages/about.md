Hello, world! I'm **Jeperson**, from Caloocan City, Philippines. I began my academic journey by pursuing the Information and Communications Technology Strand at Bestlink College of the Philippines. I'm on the verge of completing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Colegio De Sta. Teresa De Avila, Inc. in Quezon City, Philippines.

Since my early years, I've been captivated by technology. My fascination sprouted from disassembling electronic toys and attempting (sometimes unsuccessfully) to reassemble them â€“ a journey that led me to tinker with and explore the software world. The spark was ignited when I encountered my first computer, which was equipped with an Intel Pentium 4 processor. Engaging in MMORPGs and Open World games, I couldn't help but dissect and modify them, diving into the software realm using tools like Cheat Engine. Witnessing the intricacies of memory addresses through Cheat Engine's UI fascinated me, propelling me further into the world of technology.

I thrive in various technological domains, including web development, the Internet of Things, and electronics prototyping. My academic journey culminated in a Capstone and Research Project focused on addressing interoperability and vendor lock-in issues within the Internet of Things Consumer Domain for Smart Home Systems. This project also involved developing practical smart devices for real-world applications.

>Beyond bits and bytes, I share my world with **Eco**, a mischievous feline companion notorious for his playful keyboard hops during my coding sessions. I might even try teaching **Eco** some [coding skills](http://jsforcats.com/) â€“ a fun idea, don't you think? ðŸ¤”
